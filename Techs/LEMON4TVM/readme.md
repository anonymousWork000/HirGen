## LEMON4TVM Introcuction

Use the model generated by LEMON and import the generated model into TVM to perform a compilation, then compare the predictions of the model before and after the TVM compilation for a given identical input to see if they are consistent. If they do not agree then a bug is thrown, otherwise LEMON continues to generate the next model for testing.

## How to run

```powershell
python -u -m run.mutation_executor experiments.conf
```

## Output file

LEMON4TVM's result is recorded in `test_time.log`. This file includes the path to the generated models, timestamp and testing results.
